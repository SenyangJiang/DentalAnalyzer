# Dental Analyzer
## Overview
**Dental Analyzer** is a tool to evaluate metrics of digital crown prep models. These metrics can be compared to their ideal values, in order to determine how well the crown model is prepared. More information is included in the documentation `DentalAnalyzer.docx`, which includes a tutorial of how to download and use the tool, as well as more details of how each metric is computed at the end.

## What Dental Analyzer computes

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Shoulder width | Distance between margin line and axial line |
| Axial Wall Height | Distance between axial line and occlusal line |
| Taper | Half of total occlusal convergence, which is the angle formed between opposing axial walls |
| Margin Depth | Distance between axial walls of student prep and original prep, at 0.5mm above the margin line |
| Occlusal Reduction | Distance between occlusal of student prep and original prep |
| Gingival Extension | Distance between the margin line and gingiva line |
